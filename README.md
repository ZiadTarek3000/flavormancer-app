## Architecture

#### Type
- Component-based React architecture (functional components + hooks, feature/component-level state, custom hooks).
- No global state library (e.g., Redux) or formal layered architecture (Clean, MVVM) is currently used.

#### Why we chose this
- Aligns with React's unidirectional data flow and hooks-first patterns.
- Minimal boilerplate and dependencies → faster iteration and easier onboarding.
- Easier to reason about, test, and maintain for a small-to-medium app.
- Scales incrementally — add Context/Redux or adopt a layered/clean architecture later if complexity grows.
